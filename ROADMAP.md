# Roadmap
This roadmap intends to provide transparency about features and fixes we plan to include in future releases of Hot Stuff. 

While we are committed to timely updates, you may have noticed that we neglected to provide ETAs for any version milestones, and that's because we believe keeping to these artifical deadlines 
while maintaining our standards of quality would likely have been impractical in the long run. If you have any questions or concerns about the content or status of a future release, feel free 
to start a [discussion](https://github.com/PamCatten/hot-stuff/discussions) or reach out over [email](mailto:campatten.dev@outlook.com).
