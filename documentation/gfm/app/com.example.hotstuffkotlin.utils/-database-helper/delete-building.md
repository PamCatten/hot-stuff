# deleteBuilding

[androidJvm]\
fun [deleteBuilding](delete-building.md)(id: [Int](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html))

Delete the row of the passed building id in the database and toast the result (whether success/failure).

As of now, [deleteBuilding](delete-building.md) is never called, but we plan to support users being able to create multiple buildings in the future, when it would presumably be of greater utility.
