[androidJvm]\
fun [addBuilding](add-building.md)(building: [Building](../../com.hotstuffkotlin.models/-building/index.md))

Add the passed building to the database and toast the result (whether success/failure).

As of now, [addBuilding](add-building.md) is only called during the onboarding process, but we plan to support users being able to create multiple buildings in the future, when it would presumably be of greater utility.
