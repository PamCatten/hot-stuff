Hot Stuff is an offline Android app designed to help users quickly record and aggregate belongings for Proof of Loss forms in insurance claims. 
// TODO: Add more, but not so much that it overwhelms

## Getting Started

#### Supported Versions
Currently, this app supports a minimum Android SDK version of **33**, and the target SDK version is **34**.

## Documentation
See the documentation for descriptions and usage examples of Hot Stuff's functions.

## Design
### Design Document
See the [technical design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/177xGpi3BK14RevmSoKWCA5AEw8B0tt4f7ILGGo3Y3MI/edit#heading=h.j040vupqoagj) for Hot Stuff.
### Design Philosophy
Hot Stuff was not built with the intention of being the end-all be-all feature-laden king of the Android home inventory software market. Ultimately, I believe these types of app to be imperfect tools for what they're charged with, so the goal was to make a middleman that was as helpful, unobstrusive, and easy-to-use as possible, to hopefully aid people as they transistioned to the preferred format of insurance providers—the spreadsheet. 

// FINISH SOAPBOX HERE, KEEP IT BRIEF

The trade-off for storing records locally are brutal; no information is shared between devices, meaning that upon deletion or device destruction, everything—potentially hours of work, is lost, with no potential for recovery. Devastating.

That is to say that ideally, Hot Stuff has a shelf life, because the risks borne of an extended stay after users start adding items are too great. The optimal lifecycle should look a little like: users download the app, learn a little about the process and their insurance, record belongings at their convenience, transfer the manifest to a spreadsheet via .CSV, and then delete the app and get along with their lives. 

## Accessibility
// TODO: Extremely important, include references to all work done for this objective
### Screen Reader Support
### Right-to-Left Text Support
### Additional Language Support

## Similar software
The format of Hot Stuff is entirely my own creation, which is unfortunate, because it means I put a lot time into re-inventing stuff that already exists! If, like me, you didn't know the name of this type of project, and as a result, didn't know what to google when you started, these apps are called home inventory or inventory management software. 

Due to its offline nature, FOSS-ness, requiring no account or personal information, and a (relatively) lighter size, Hot Stuff still serves a niche unfilled by some of the other software listed below; with the caveat that the general structure will likely be similar to some, if not all of the other applications.
