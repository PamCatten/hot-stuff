# Hot Stuff Privacy Policy
#### Last Modified: March 3, 2024

The terms used in this Privacy Policy (the "policy") have the same meanings as in our [Terms of Use](https://github.com/PamCatten/hot-stuff/blob/main/TERMS), unless 
otherwise defined in the policy itself.

This policy is entered into by and between you and the developer(s) of Hot Stuff ("Developers", “we,” “our,” or “us”), and is meant to inform users regarding our 
practices associated with the collection, use, and/or disclosure of Personal Information ("data").

Both your access and use of the Hot Stuff mobile application (the “App”), including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through the App, is 
contingent upon acceptance of the provisions laid out in this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, do not download, access, or use the App (and if already 
downloaded, delete the App from your mobile device), but please get in touch with us so we can try to help. 

We value the trust you place with us when using our App with your data, and we strive to protect it in any way that we can. We also know that as volunteers we 
lack the resources needed to ensure that data's security once transmitted out over the internet to the level worthy of that trust. Accordingly, the App operates 
offline, its core functionalties require no interent connection to work as intended.

In addition, the App does not collect or require any user information, demographic (age, sex, etc.), personal (name, email, location, etc.), or otherwise. The App 
does not use any cookies or employ any third-party companies, individuals, or other means of distinguishing users. Lastly, the App does not collect any log data, 
although in the future we plan to add an optional preference for users to opt-in to providing basic device analytics to help us investigate the cause of reported 
bugs or crashes.

We may update the policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to periodically review this policy for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new 
policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.

If you have any remaining questions, or wish to comment or make a suggestion related to the policy, please create an issue on GitHub or direct them to: campatten.dev@outlook.com.
