    <string name="article_whyCare_title">Hot Stuff: Simplify Your Fire Claims</string>
    <string name="article_whyCare_text">
        House fires are sudden, chaotic events, and while the thought of one breaking out may seem
        unlikely, a house fire is reported in the United States every 88 secondsÂ¹.
        Unfortunately for many, the aftermath can be just as painful as the fire itself, because
        while fires burn out, their victim\'s trauma carries on. While only some suffer with
        the painful physical reminders of a fire, all deal with the heavy emotional strain that
        comes with the fear and anxiety of displacement or potential homelessness,
        losing their sense of safety and security, and the mounting stress that comes with the
        financial challenges of pulling their lives back together.

        \n\nThis is where we can help, because Hot Stuff isn\'t just about reacting to a crisis; it\'s
        about helping you avoid the worst of it. By using Hot Stuff to catalog your possessions in
        advance, you\'re creating a digital inventory that serves as a comprehensive record of your
        belongings. While the hope is that it is never necessary, if a fire occurs, having a
        specific, detailed catalog in advance can put you on the path to:
        \n\n1. Getting fair value for your possessions, without the influence of
        self-interested insurance companies or independent adjusters
        \n\n2. Expediting your claims process, so you can get back to restoring what was lost sooner
        rather than later
        \n\n3. Having the peace of mind knowing your possessions are secured, leaving you to free to
        focus on what matters most in life: the stuff that money can\'t buy

        \n\nTaking the time to plan ahead for these unexpected, traumatic times can make a real
        difference when it matters most, because it\'s much easier to remember everything in a room
        when it\'s right there in front of you, than days or weeks later when it\'s all gone.
        Hot Stuff was created with this in mind, an app that people could trade a few rainy
        afternoons using, for the peace of mind knowing that if something were to happen, they
        would be better prepared for this horrific possibility.

        \n\nHot Stuff was designed ultimately to be an accessible tool, it requires no internet
        connection, collects no data, has no ads, is fully open sourced software, and perhaps most
        importantly, is completely free (but if you\'re reading this you already knew that)!
        If you find a bug, have an idea on how to improve the app, want to help translate or to
        contribute in some other way, please get in touch! Community feedback is always welcomed
        and encouraged.

        \n\nSadly, Hot Stuff is not a one-stop shop for all of someone\'s needs after a fire.
        While we can\'t protect people from suffering the injustice and heartache of losing where
        they live, we are grateful and proud to be of assistance (for at least our small part) of
        the long, challenging road back home.
