        Welcome! This guide exists to provide a brief introduction to Hot Stuff\'s features and to
        explain the basic workflow of cataloging your possessions.

        \n\nFeatures
        \nHome: See charts and summaries of the items you have saved.

        \n\nItems: Scroll or search through saved items, export item records, and view, update, and
        delete saved items.

        \n\nCreate: Enter details, take photos, and save new records of your items.

        \n\nWorkflow
        \nStep 1: Tap the \'Create\' icon in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.

        \n\nStep 2: Fill in the required details for the item, including the name, quantity,
        category, and room. The rest of the form, including brand/manufacturer, item value,
        description, and a photo of
        the item, are all relevant, recommended information to include, but they aren\'t needed to
        save an item to your records.

        \n\nStep 3: Save the item to your records by pressing the \'Save Item\' button at the end of
        the form, a message should appear at the bottom of the screen when your item has been saved.

        \n\nStep 4: To save another item you can stay on the \'Create\' screen to begin the process
        again, however, if you wish to see your item or modify it\'s details, you can click
        on the \'Items\' icon in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen to see a scrollable
        list of items you\'ve saved.

        \n\nStep 5: To modify your item, you can either scroll through the list until you
        find it, or you can tap the \'Search\' icon in the toolbar at the top of the screen to search
        your database for items with names, categories, rooms, and brands/manufacturers similar to
        what you type into the search bar.

        \n\nStep 6: To edit an item, you can tap the \'Edit\' button at the bottom of the
        screen to be taken to a screen similar to the \'Create\' items page. Any changes you make
        here can be saved by pressing the \'Save Changes\' button at the bottom of the screen, if
        you don\'t wish to change any of your item\'s details you can tap the back arrow icon at
        the top of the screen to return to the details page.

        \n\nStep 7: To delete an item, you can tap the \'Delete\' button at the bottom of the screen.
        A popup will appear asking if you\'re sure, if you press \'Delete\' again you\'ll be brought
        back to the \'Items\' screen and a message should appear at the bottom of the screen when
        your item has been deleted.

        \n\nThat\'s the basic flow of the app! If you want to export your item records, you can read
        more about it in the \'Exporting records\' walkthrough. If you find a bug or want to give
        some feedback you can tap the \'Options\' in the toolbar at the top of the screen to open a
        menu with those resources.

        \n\nLastly, if you have a question not answered here or need some further assistance, please
        visit our GitHub (linked in the \'About Hot Stuff\' section of the \'Learn\' screen), it
        should have resources and links to get in contact with the developer.

    <string name="article_whyCare_title">Hot Stuff: Simplify Your Fire Claims</string>
    <string name="article_whyCare_text">
        House fires are sudden, chaotic events, and while the thought of one breaking out may seem
        unlikely, a house fire is reported in the United States every 88 secondsÂ¹.
        Unfortunately for many, the aftermath can be just as painful as the fire itself, because
        while fires burn out, their victim\'s trauma carries on. While only some suffer with
        the painful physical reminders of a fire, all deal with the heavy emotional strain that
        comes with the fear and anxiety of displacement or potential homelessness,
        losing their sense of safety and security, and the mounting stress that comes with the
        financial challenges of pulling their lives back together.

        \n\nThis is where we can help, because Hot Stuff isn\'t just about reacting to a crisis; it\'s
        about helping you avoid the worst of it. By using Hot Stuff to catalog your possessions in
        advance, you\'re creating a digital inventory that serves as a comprehensive record of your
        belongings. While the hope is that it is never necessary, if a fire occurs, having a
        specific, detailed catalog in advance can put you on the path to:
        \n\n1. Getting fair value for your possessions, without the influence of
        self-interested insurance companies or public adjusters
        \n\n2. Expediting your claims process, so you can get back to restoring what was lost sooner
        rather than later
        \n\n3. Having the peace of mind knowing your possessions are secured, leaving you to free to
        focus on what matters most in life: the stuff that money can\'t buy

        \n\nTaking the time to plan ahead for these unexpected, traumatic times can make a real
        difference when it matters most, because it\'s much easier to remember everything in a room
        when it\'s right there in front of you, than days or weeks later when it\'s all gone.
        Hot Stuff was created with this in mind, an app that people could trade a few rainy
        afternoons using, for the peace of mind knowing that if something were to happen, they
        would be better prepared for this horrific possibility.

        \n\nHot Stuff was designed ultimately to be an accessible tool, it requires no internet
        connection, collects no data, has no ads, is fully open sourced software, and perhaps most
        importantly, is completely free (but if you\'re reading this you already knew that)!
        If you find a bug, have an idea on how to improve the app, want to help translate or to
        contribute in some other way, please get in touch! Community feedback is always welcomed
        and encouraged.

        \n\nSadly, Hot Stuff is not a one-stop shop for all of someone\'s needs after a fire.
        While we can\'t protect people from suffering the injustice and heartache of losing where
        they live, we are grateful and proud to be of assistance (for at least our small part) of
        the long, challenging road back home.

    <string name="article_detail_title">Attention to Detail: Why it Matters</string>
    <string name="article_detail_text">
        In the face of the unexpected, having a detailed home inventory is an essential part of
        having a smooth and successful experience when filing insurance claims. Every home is filled
        with valued possessions and taking the time to make records of them ensures that when
        disaster strikes they can accurately be accounted for.

        \n\nAttention to detail is the linchpin in accurately valuing possessions. Providing
        specific, precise details, like serial number, model name, manufacturer, price, receipt, etc.
        ensures that an insurance provider cannot undervalue a policyholder\'s belongings.

        \n\nThe most efficient way to create a home inventory is by approaching it systematically.
        Opening every drawer, every cabinet, and moving through the house, finishing one room and
        then moving on to the next. Not only does this help ensure complete coverage, but it also
        makes the challenge more manageable.

        \n\nA home inventory is an ongoing process, not a one-time task, it\'s okay if it takes
        several days, weeks, or months to finish. However, when finished it is important to stay on
        top of updating the inventory, ideally a few times a year, to avoid forgetting about details
        when adding new items or remembering to remove old ones.
        Keeping an inventory current guarantees that coverage remains reflective of a home\'s true
        value, and strengthens a policyholder\'s case during the claims process.

        \n\nSome policyholders focus only on the larger, more expensive items, which is fair, people
        have a lot of stuff, and recording all of it can be a time-consuming process. However, it is
        important to remember that the little, mundane things in life can add up very quickly.

        \n\nIn a total loss most people may forget about or skip over bathrooms entirely, and yet
        they would likely be missing out on hundreds of dollars of losses. Life has gotten to be so
        expensive, consider the cost of:

        \n\nshampoos,
        \nlotions,
        \nconditioner,
        \nscale,
        \nsoap dispenser,
        \ntoilet brush,
        \nhairdryer,
        \nbath mat,
        \nshower curtain,
        \ncurtain liner,
        \ncurtain rod,
        \ncurtain rings,
        \nplunger,
        \nsoap bars,
        \nmedications,
        \ntrash can,
        \ntowels,
        \ntoothpaste,
        \nrazors,
        \nhairbrushes,
        \nnail clippers,
        \nmouthwash,
        \ntoothbrushes, etc.

        \n\nThink of all the different items not mentioned here, and imagine trying to remember all
        of them and more a few days after your life has fallen apart. These mundane items can be a
        pain to record now, but again, they add up quick.

        \n\nA final note, when recording more expensive items policyholders should
        check to make sure that the items they\'re recording are worth more than their coverage limits,
        and if so, deciding whether the want to schedule property endorsements with their insurance
        provider to cover the full amount of those specific items. While they increase premiums, the
        limits on things like jewelry, clothing, liquor, antiques, collectibles, etc. tend to be pretty low, so it\'s a
        conversation worth having if a policyholder can afford it.

    <string name="article_likeKind_title">Like Kind and Quality</string>
    <string name="article_likeKind_text">
        \'Like kind and quality\' refers to a principle that, in the event of a covered loss, the
        insurance provider is obligated to replace or repair the damaged property with items of a
        similar nature and value. This principle ensures that policyholders are not left with
        inferior replacements or repairs after a covered incident.

        \n\nNot all insurance policies bind providers to the principle, as such policyholders may
        want to familiarize themselves with the language specific to their policy, as different
        providers can have different terms, definitions, and conditions of coverage.

        \n\nLying on an insurance claim is a terrible idea, it is both illegal and can cause
        policyholders even bigger problems (such as invalidating entire claims). However,
        sometimes it may make sense not to be forthcoming with the entire truth; Particularly with
        items that possess unique or specific features that contribute to their value, and may not
        have equivalents in the market that perfectly match their distinct characteristics.

        \n\nFor example, a vintage watch, a custom-made piece of furniture, a high-resolution camera,
        or a rare collectible are all likely to have a combination of niche features that are
        difficult for insurance providers to easily find replacements for on the open market. A
        policyholder that strongly insists on a fair replacement for those features, with calm,
        clear reasoning for their position, may find that the replacement cost of a comparable item
        is likely to be fairly expensive, potentially more expensive than the appraised value of a
        specific, very detailed item.

    <string name="article_adjusters_title">Public Adjusters: Pros and Cons</string>
    <string name="article_adjusters_text">
    Dealing with insurance claims can be a daunting task by itself, and it is often made even worse
    by the heartache and stress that comes in the aftermath of major damage. When facing this
    challenge policyholders often find themselves at a crossroads: should they navigate the difficult
    process alone or enlist the assistance of a public adjuster? While public adjusters can offer
    valuable expertise, it\'s crucial to understand both the advantages and drawbacks before
    deciding to hire one.

    \n\nPros:

    \n\nMaximizing Compensation
    \nThe biggest advantage of hiring a public adjuster is their expertise. They do this through
    industry knowledge; such as knowing where to look for potential missed damage or how best to
    create records of what was lost; and through negotiation, to maximize their client\'s best
    possible settlement.

    \n\nGuidance
    \nPublic adjusters have an in-depth knowledge of the claims processes. An adjuster\'s expertise
    can help them translate jargon and legalese so clients can better understand the details of their
    policies.

    \n\nTime and Stress Relief
    \nManaging an insurance claim can be a stressful and time-consuming process. Public adjusters
    handle the paperwork, communication, and negotiations, allowing their clients to focus on
    putting their lives back together.

    \n\nDisputes
    \nPublic adjusters can review and renegotiate settlements if a policyholder is unhappy with their
    insurance provider\'s initial offer.

    \n\nCons:

    \n\nCost
    \nThe largest drawback of hiring a public adjuster, the cost is usually between 5% to 20% of the
    final settlement, or in some cases, a flat or hourly rate. While some areas may cap the total
    fee an adjuster can receive, and some adjusters are open to negotiating their fees, policyholders
    everywhere need to weigh the benefits adjusters provide with the costs, which are paid directly
    from their payouts.

    \n\nSuitability
    \nNot every insurance claim warrants the involvement of a public adjuster. For smaller or
    uncomplicated claims, it is likely more cost-effective for policyholders to handle them by
    themselves, avoiding the added expense the adjuster will make on their settlement. In fact,
    some adjusters will even refuse claims below a certain level of payout, so it\'s crucial that
    policyholders assess the complexity of their claim before deciding whether a public adjuster is
    necessary.

    \n\nPayout Limits
    \nPublic adjusters cannot get more money for their clients from insurance providers than they
    have coverage for in their policy. The limit of insurance or limit of liability in a policy is
    the maximum amount a policyholder can receive, and it\'s extremely unlikely a public adjuster
    will be able to negotiate a settlement above that amount.

    \n\nClaim Processing Delays
    \nHiring a public adjuster often extends how long it takes for claims to be processed, as they
    negotiate back and forth with the insurance provider over the final settlement amount. Generally,
    the more complicated the claim, the longer it will take for a public adjuster and provider to
    hash out the details, extending the period a policyholder has to wait for their payout by weeks
    or months.

    \n\nAvailability and Validity
    \nOnly some areas require public adjusters to be licensed, in others no qualifications are
    required at all, which can lead to vulnerable people being taken advantage of. When hiring an
    adjuster policyholders should make sure they fully understand the details of the contract and
    the structure of fees before signing anything.

    \n\nUltimately, hiring a public adjuster can be a strategic move, but it\'s essential for
    policyholders to carefully consider if the circumstances of their claim are appropriate for the
    cost of professional assistance.
